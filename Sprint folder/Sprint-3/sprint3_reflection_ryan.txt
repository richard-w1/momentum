This sprint we focused on adding new features and making the habit tracker more interactive. The main thing I worked on was creating the progress tracker. Our goal for this task was to show the users how they’ve been doing with their habits by giving them a way to see their consistency over time. We wanted it to be simple but still give useful feedback on how they were doing, like showing how many habits were completed, missed, or still active.
To build the tracker, I had to figure out how to pull the right data from our habit model, especially the dates when habits were completed. I used that to calculate stats like completion rates and show that visually on the dashboard. I also worked on displaying this data in a way that made sense to the user. I kept the design clean so it fits in with the rest of the site and made sure it was responsive.
A challenge I ran into was figuring out how to calculate the missed habits. Since habits are tracked daily, I had to compare the current date against the expected days a habit should be completed. It took a bit of just trying out different things to get it working right, especially when I needed to handle the edge cases like habits that were just created or ones the user hadn’t interacted with yet.
I learned a lot more about how Django works with logic on the backend and how we can take that data and pass it to the frontend to make something that feels interactive. I also got better at testing and checking my code to make sure it’s doing what it’s supposed to before I push anything.
For the next sprint, I want to keep improving the progress tracking and maybe even turn it into a graph or chart for a better visual. I also want to help out with any styling or bug fixing that needs to be done as we get closer to finishing the core features. Lastly, get started with my new tasks for example creating a profile picture as well as skipping tasks.
