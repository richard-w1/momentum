This sprint I was able to finish up a couple key features that added more customization and flexibility for users. One of the features I did  was allowing users to upload a custom profile picture. Before this, the profiles were just a default image, so this helped make accounts more personal. I made it so users could upload an image from their device and have it display on their profile page. I also tested a few different image formats to make sure everything worked smoothly.

The other feature I worked on was letting users skip a habit. This is meant for special occasions, but the idea was to give users some flexibility without messing up their progress or streak. I updated the habit model to handle skipped entries and made sure it wouldn’t affect XP or streaks. Users can also include a reason for skipping, which gives them a way to keep track of why they didn’t complete something.

One of the biggest issues I ran into was with the skip button itself. At first, it was more of a visual feature and didn’t actually do anything. I had to consistently go back and forth to test different code to see that pressing the skip button would actually register a skipped habit in the database. It took some time to figure out how to separate a skipped habit from a missed one so it wouldn’t throw off the progress tracker or streak calculations.

I learned a lot more about Django’s form handling and how to manage file uploads for the profile picture. I also got more comfortable working with custom logic inside views and updating models in a way that doesn’t break other features that rely on habit data. For the next sprint, I want to continue working on the habit skip feature, especially finishing how skipped reasons are shown to the user. As well as that I would like to work on the leaderboard and gamification portion of the website.
