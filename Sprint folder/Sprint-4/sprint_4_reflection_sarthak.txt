Sprint 4 Reflections

What did you do?
During this sprint, I worked on the analytics for the habit tracker. First, I made a view to return the raw, habit data as a JSON file. Next, the script in the front end is called which uses the JSON response to display the graph. I used the Javascript library charts.js to make the pie chart for the habits. I also made the habit list a dropdown allowing the users to minimize the list using jQuery.

Challenges: 
I researched what library to use before I chose the library so there weren't any issues integrating it. However, getting the data to the script was a bit tedious. The chart.js library expects two lists of keys and values and parsing that into a JSON response from the Django view was difficult. Here the inspect element developer console was very helpful being able to print out the JSON format to the console. 

For the dropdown, I used JQuery for the first time. This involved selecting HTML elements by ID or class. The inspect element console was again very helpful here as I checked if the triggers were working by printing test messages to the console.

The most difficult part of the sprint was turning the habit data into something useful. I could use the data to display some simple statistics like completion rate that was about it. This task is more of a data analytics   task rather than an engineering one. I am still looking into more statistical operations to make the data more useful.

What did you learn?Â 
I got familiar with more components of the webpage. I used JQuery for the first time. Creating triggers for scripts based on user actions like cursor hover or click. I also learned how to hide and show content with CSS using JQuery.

What could have been improved?
A better understanding of available development tools would have made the development process easier.
