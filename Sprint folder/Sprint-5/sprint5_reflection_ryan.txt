This sprint I worked on the friends section and the progress section. For the friends feature, I made it so users can search for other users by name and add them. Once added, they show up in your friends list. It makes the app feel more interactive and adds to the idea of comparing progress or competing with friends later on. I also made sure that the system doesn’t let you add someone more than once, and that it handles errors if the search input is empty or doesn’t match anyone.

The other portion I worked on for this sprint was the progress section. This shows how much someone has done since they started using the app. It tracks total habits completed, missed, skipped, and their current streak. The goal was to give users a clean overview of how they’re doing all in one place. I spent time making sure it was readable and responsive, and matched the rest of the design.

One of the main problems I had was getting the progress section to show the correct numbers. At first it was pulling incorrect stats like counting skipped habits as missed, which messed up the streak and completion rate. I had to go in and fix how the data was being filtered so it would only show what it’s supposed to. The friends search also gave me some issues early on. I had to make sure it wouldn’t break if you typed something random or tried to add someone who was already on your list.

These last two sprints really helped me get better at using Django queries and figuring out how to pass the right stuff into templates. I also feel more confident testing my code and making sure it doesn’t mess up other parts of the site. Since we are complete, I feel more confident compared to when we first started the project. In the end, I’m happy with what I was able to contribute and how it all came together.
