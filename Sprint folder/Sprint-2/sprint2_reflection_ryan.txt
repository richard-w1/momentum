This sprint I was able to start taking on some of the tasks from our ClickUp board and begin coding features that fit into the main project. I’ve still been learning Django and figuring out how everything connects, but I’ve been making good progress and now feel a lot more confident. Whenever I take on a task, I try to work on it on my own first, and once I finish and test it, I’ll send it back to the group to check before it gets fully added in. That way I’m not just learning, but actually building things that are meant to go into the project.

One of the main areas I focused on this sprint was understanding how the habit management system works so I can contribute to similar features. This sprint, we added things like creating and updating habits, deleting them, and tracking completions. We also made it so the app keeps up with streaks and missed days. I’ve been reading through that code to see how it’s structured and using it as a reference while I work on my own pieces. I’ve also been looking at the profile update section, since it was updated to let users change their name, birthday, bio, and password, which is something I might be able to help expand later.

We did run into a few issues during the sprint. One of the big ones was that our habit tracking system originally didn’t save when the habit was completed—it just marked it as done. That made it hard to show progress, so we fixed it by recording the actual dates, which made everything work better for analytics. There was also a problem with the Edit Profile page trying to show a hashed password, which was causing errors, so we moved the password update to its own page to avoid that.

For the next sprint, I plan to keep working on features from ClickUp, especially things related to the dashboard and notifications. I’ve already started coding a couple pieces and just need to finish them and get feedback before they’re ready to be added in. I definitely feel more comfortable than I did last sprint and want to keep building off that by being more involved in the actual development.
