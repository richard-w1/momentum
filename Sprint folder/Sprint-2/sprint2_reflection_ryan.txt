This sprint I was able to start taking on tasks from our ClickUp board and coding features that fit into the main project. I’ve still been learning Django and figuring out how everything connects, but I’ve been making good progress and feel a lot more confident. When I try to do  a task, I try to work on it on my own first, and once I finish and test it, I send it back to the group to check before it gets added in. That way I’m not just learning, but actually building things that go into the project.
One of the main areas I focused on this sprint was understanding how the habit management system works. We added things like creating and updating habits, deleting them, and tracking completions. The app now keeps up with streaks and missed days. I’ve been reading through that code to see how it’s structured and using it as a reference while I work on my own pieces. I’ve also looked at the profile update section, since it was updated to let users change their name, birthday, bio, and password.
We ran into a few issues during the sprint. One of the bigger ones was that the habit system didn’t save the specific dates habits were completed—it just marked them as done. That made it hard to track progress, so we fixed it by recording the actual dates. There was also a problem with the Edit Profile page trying to show a hashed password, which caused errors. That was fixed by moving the password update to its own page.
For the next sprint, I plan to keep working on features from ClickUp, especially things related to the dashboard and notifications. I’ve already started coding a couple parts and just need to finish them and get feedback before they’re added in. I definitely feel more comfortable than I did last sprint and want to keep building off that by being more involved in the actual development.
