This sprint was mostly about getting everything set up and making sure I understood the project so I could contribute moving forward. I have been working on learning Django and how to code using it, since it is completely new to me. But by doing this I have learning a lot and feel ready to code so I can implement it into the project. As well as that I spent time going through the files, setting up Django, and making sure the app ran on my machine. I also have been tracking how we are planning out features and organizing work so I will be ready to jump in next sprint.
The biggest challenge I ran into was getting my environment set up properly. At first, I was running into some problems with the migrations, which had me stuck for a while. After trying different fixes and checking Djangoâ€™s documentation, I finally got it working. This made me realize how we need everyone on the team to have the same setup so we do not keep running into the same issues. So we decided it would be better to setup instructions or a guide to make things easier.
Since I have been working with Django and learning it, I have learned a lot about how projects are structured, how migrations work, and how the backends and frontends correlate and connect. I also have a better idea of how we are breaking things into sprints, which helps keep everything organized and on track.
For the next sprint, I want to take what I have been practicing and actually contribute code to the project, whether that is on the frontend or helping with backend logic. I also think I could help improve documentation for setting up the project since I struggled with that and now have a better idea of where people might get stuck. My main goal is to go from just working on Django separately to actually building something for the project.
